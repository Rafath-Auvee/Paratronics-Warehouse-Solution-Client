        <h1>Question 1: Difference between javascript and nodejs</h1>
        <p>
          Answer: 1. JavaScript is a simple programming language that runs in
          any browser JavaScript Engine. Whereas Node JS is an interpreter or
          running environment for a JavaScript programming language that holds
          many excesses. 2. JavaScript is normally used for any client-side
          activity for one web application. Node JS mainly used for accessing or
          running any operating system for non-blocking operation. 3. JavaScript
          programming is very easy to write, and put any running environment
          means proper browser. Whereas Node JS only support the V8 engine,
          which googles chrome specific. But whether it supports the V8 engine,
          written JavaScript code can able to run in any environment. So there
          has no browser-specific constraint on it. 4. JavaScript is normally
          following Java Programming language standard. There may have some
          different way of writing code, but at the same time, we can say it
          following the Java Programming language standard. Whereas node JS is
          written in C++ and provides a V8 engine base browser javascript
          running engine, it helps us run a written javascript program in any
          browser environment. 5. For accessing any operating system, specific
          non-blocking task JavaScript has some specific object, but all of them
          are operating system specific. Node JS is very much familiar to create
          a specific binding with the file system and allows the developer to
          read or sometimes write on disk.

          Question 2: When should you use nodejs and when should you use mongodb
        </h1>
        <p>
          Answer: Using MongoDB: But, MongoDB is NoSQL database which is
          document oriented. It represents data as of JSON documents. It's used
          for store data. Using NodeJS: Shortly we can say, NodeJS is a
          JavaScript runtime environment. It's actually helps JavaScript to run
          outside of server. It's used in server side development. So we can say
          MongoDB is a database where we can store data and NodeJS helps us to
          to connect our client site to database by it's server site.

        <h1>Question 3: Differences between sql and nosql databases.</h1>
        <p>
          Answer: SQL databases are relational, NoSQL databases are
          non-relational. SQL databases use structured query language and have a
          predefined schema. NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for
          unstructured data. SQL databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL
          databases are horizontally scalable. SQL databases are table-based,
          while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column
          stores. SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, while
          NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.

        <h1>Question 4: What is the purpose of jwt and how does it work</h1>
        <p>
          Answer: JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share
          security information between two parties — a client and a server. Each
          JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are
          signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims
          cannot be altered after the token is issued. A JWT is a string made up
          of three parts, separated by dots (.), and serialized using base64. In
          the most common serialization format, compact serialization, the JWT
          looks something like this: xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz. Once decoded, you will
          get two JSON strings: 1.The header and the payload. 2.The signature.
